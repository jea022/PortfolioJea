# === INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAINTAINERS ===
#
# To add new code owners:
# 1. Use the format: <file_pattern> <owner1> <owner2> ...
# 2. Owners can be GitHub usernames (with @) or team names (with @org/team-name)
# 3. More specific patterns override less specific ones
# 4. Patterns use the same syntax as .gitignore
#
# Examples:
# - Specific file: /path/to/file.txt @username
# - Directory: /path/to/dir/ @username
# - File type: *.js @username
# - Multiple owners: /path/ @user1 @user2
# - Team: /path/ @org/team-name
#
# Common patterns:
# - All TypeScript files: *.ts @username
# - All test files: *.test.ts @username
# - Specific directory and subdirectories: /src/ @username
# - Root files only: /*.md @username
#
# Best Practices:
# - Keep this file organized and documented
# - Use teams instead of individuals when possible
# - Be specific with patterns to avoid over-requesting reviews
# - Review and update regularly as the project evolves
#
# Testing:
# You can test CODEOWNERS patterns using GitHub's UI or CLI
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#testing-code-owners
